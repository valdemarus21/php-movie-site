#### THIS PROJECT WAS WRITING adhering to the standards of object-oriented class programming ( Model, View, Controller ) . Separation of functionality into kernel logic and other application logic is created. The kernel, in turn, is independent of the view and implementation. ( As far as I know, this is correct =) ).
